# Brief for research agents

You're helping Behind the Jersey, an open dataset of who really pays for the sponsors on sports shirts, and how much human-rights abuse sits behind the money. You'll research one issue and deliver it as a pull request that a person reviews. Anyone can run you: a maintainer, a volunteer, or a journalist's agent.

## Before you start

- **Read:**
  - [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md): the format and the source rules;
  - [`METHOD.md`](../METHOD.md): tiers and the rating rule;
  - the schemas in [`schema/`](../schema), which say what each field means.
- **Pick an open issue** labelled `club`, `league`, `sport` or `research` that nobody is assigned to. Comment "Taking this", with who runs you.
- **Work on a branch** named after the issue, e.g. `research/ligue-1-257`. Never push to `main`, never merge, never approve.

## The task

For the clubs, league or sponsors in your issue:

1. **Clubs:** make sure each club in the current season exists in `data/clubs/`, using the official league list. Add missing ones. Set `crest: null` unless `assets/` lists an image the website has.
2. **Kits:**
   - one current home kit per club in `data/kits/`, with every sponsor and its `placement` (front, back, sleeve, shorts, patch…);
   - each sponsor gets a `source`: the club's kit launch or announcement, or a named press article;
   - set `sponsorsComplete: true` only if you checked every placement.
3. **Sponsors:**
   - one record per sponsor in `data/sponsors/`;
   - search `data/` first and reuse an existing id;
   - new sponsors are `tier: "unrated"`, `status: "unrated"`.
4. **Owners:**
   - trace each sponsor's owner up to a state or fund where there is one (`parentId`), using company filings, annual reports or the sponsor's own site;
   - each owner gets a claim that states the ownership, with its source;
   - reuse existing owners (`government-of-saudi-arabia`, `saudi-pif`, `government-of-dubai`…).
5. **Evidence:** for owners that are states or state-controlled, add claims (`data/claims/`) with sourced facts about their human-rights record. Use the UN, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, courts, or the named press. Reuse existing claims where they fit.
6. **Deals:**
   - organisation sponsors (league or competition partners) go in `data/deals/` with `clubId: null`, `orgName` and `leagueId`;
   - reported deal values go in the club's deal, with their source.
7. **Check:** run `python3 scripts/validate.py` and `python3 scripts/check_links.py --base origin/main`. Fix every error.
8. **Open the pull request** with the template. Include:
   - what you added or changed (counts per type);
   - the tier you propose for each sponsor, with the claims behind it and one line of reasoning. Don't set tiers yourself.
   - facts you found but couldn't source, as plain text with where you saw them;
   - anything that disagreed between sources.

## Rules you must follow

- **Never invent anything.** That means no facts, figures, dates, owners, URLs, emails or phone numbers. Unknown is `null`, or you leave it out and list it in the pull request.
- **Open every URL you cite** and make sure it says what you claim. Wikipedia and Wikidata are for finding primary documents, not for citing.
- **Claims say only what the source says.** Your reasoning goes in the pull request, never in a claim's text.
- **State ownership alone is not a tier** ([METHOD.md](../METHOD.md)).
- **Contacts:** only fan-facing channels the club publishes, with the page they're on.
- **Don't touch** `schema/`, `scripts/`, `.github/`, or records outside your issue, unless the issue asks you to.
- **Some things don't fit the data yet:** races, fights and tournaments hosted by a state (no event record yet), and sponsors on cars (no car placement). Put them in the pull request description with their sources instead of forcing them into kits.

## When you're done

Comment on the issue with a link to your pull request and a one-paragraph summary. The review agent and CI will comment on the pull request. Answer their findings with new commits on the same branch.
