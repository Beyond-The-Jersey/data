# Contributing

Thank you for helping. You can work by hand or with an AI agent. Either way the path is the same:

1. **Pick an [issue](https://github.com/Beyond-The-Jersey/data/issues)** (or open one: *Check a club*, *Check a sponsor*, *Report an error*). Comment that you're taking it, so nobody duplicates the work.
2. **Make a branch** (or fork), and add or edit records in `data/`.
3. **Run the checks:** `pip install jsonschema && python3 scripts/validate.py`, and `python3 scripts/check_links.py --base origin/main`.
4. **Open a pull request** using the template. Say what you added, what you couldn't source, and which tiers you propose and why.
5. **CI runs, the review agent comments, and a maintainer reviews.** Nothing is published until a maintainer approves it.

Small fixes (a wrong date, a better source) can be made directly in the GitHub editor: open the record, edit it and choose "Create a new branch and start a pull request".

**Using an agent?** Point it at [`agents/research.md`](agents/research.md). It explains the task, the format and the rules. Agents never push to `main` and never merge.

## The records

Each record is one JSON file in `data/<type>/`, named after its id: `data/sponsors/visit-rwanda.json`. The schemas in `schema/` define every field; `scripts/validate.py` enforces them.

- **Ids** are ASCII kebab-case (`atletico-de-madrid`, not `atlético-de-madrid`). Before you add a record, search `data/` for an existing one: the owner `government-of-saudi-arabia` exists, so reuse it.
- **References are ids**, never names: `clubId`, `sponsorId`, `ownerId`, `claimIds`.
- **Seasons:**
  - Season leagues use `YYYY-YY` (`2026-27`) for `season`, `periodFrom` and `periodTo`.
  - Calendar-year competitions use `YYYY`.
  - A deal's `from` is when the deal started. Use `null` if you don't know; never the season you looked it up.
- **Dates** are `YYYY`, `YYYY-MM` or `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- **Money** is the reported value with its source, `upTo: true` when the report says "up to", and `usdApprox` for the dollar figure. Unknown is `value: null`, never a guess.
- **Kits:**
  - one per club per season (or per period when nothing changed);
  - every sponsor with its `placement`, and a `source` for each;
  - `sponsorsComplete: true` only when you've checked every placement;
  - `photos` only for images the website has (see `assets/`).

## Sources

Every fact carries a `source`: `{ "name", "date", "url" }` of the **primary document**. That means the club's announcement, the company's filing or annual report, the UN or NGO report, or a named press article.

- **Open every link you cite.** `check_links.py` fails a pull request whose links are gone.
- **Wikipedia and Wikidata are not sources.** Use them to find the primary document.
- **Never invent:** no placeholder URLs (`example.com`), no "inference" or "industry analysis" as a source, no made-up owners, emails or phone numbers. If you can't source something, leave it out and list it in your pull request.
- **Claims** (`data/claims/`) are short statements about an **owner**, in plain words, saying only what the source says. A deal is not a claim: it goes in `data/deals/` or on a kit.
- **Contacts** are only channels a club publishes for fans (the supporter liaison officer, a fan-services inbox, a contact page), each with the page it's on. Never ticket offices, shops, hospitality or named staff.

## Ratings

Read [METHOD.md](METHOD.md). In short:

- New sponsors are `tier: "unrated"`, `status: "unrated"`, and new claims are `reviewed: false`.
- State ownership alone is not a tier.
- Propose tiers in your pull request, with the claims that support them. A maintainer sets them.
